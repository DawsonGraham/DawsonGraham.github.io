	<h3>Ragnar Lothbrok</h3>
	<p> Although he was rumored to be father to many children, the tale of Ragnar's four sons run deep within Norse history and the world when they decide to raid England in vengeance over their father's killing. The four sons are:
		<ul>
			<li><em><strong>Bjorn Ironside:</strong></em> Ragnar's oldest son of the four, who was also a legendary king of Sweden. He was given the name 'Ironside' for his durability throughout frequent raids</li>
			<li><em><strong>Ivar the Boneless:</strong></em> The fourth son of Ragnar. He was the leader of the "Great Heathen Army" in 865. This was the legendary vengeance raid that Ragnar's sons waged on now England for the killing of their father.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Hvitserk:</strong></em> Second son of Ragnar who fought in the Great Heathen Army. Usually appears to be the most cheerful of the sons.</li>
			<li><em><strong>Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye:</strong></em> The third son of Ragnar with a nasty attitude. He was killed by Ivar after he insulted him one too many times</li>
		</ul>
